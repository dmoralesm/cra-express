This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Here I created a basic React app that consumes an API created with Express.

I filled some gaps using next tutorials:
- https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-create-react-app-work-with-a-node-backend-api-7c5c48acb1b0
- https://daveceddia.com/deploy-react-express-app-heroku/

## Run project

### Development
